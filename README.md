# dbasic

Dartmouth BASIC is the original implementation of the BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) Programming Language.

This is a reimplementation by Lisias in different useful languages, based on the original work by WA6YDQ, aiming to provide a simple and common scripting mechanism for projects in different languages and architectures.
